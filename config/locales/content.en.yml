      On behalf of the Organizing Committee and the Pan African Burn Society (PABS), I am pleased to invite you to visit Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire in 2015, where the 6th Congress of the Pan African Burn Society (PABS)will take place at the Golf Hotel from Tuesday, May 12 to Friday, May 15, 2015.

      This is the first time a West African French speaking country will host this Congress. Cote d’Ivoire is very honored to be involved with such a historic event, crucial for Public Health across all Africa.

      This 6th PABS Congress will be a symbol of a new hope; not just for the burn victims, but for all Africans.  The Local Organizing Committee along with local burn practitioners and colleagues from Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, Togo, UK, Canada, US, and many others, are working hard to prepare an exciting scientific program together with a variety of social and relaxing events for everyone.

      We look forward to welcoming you to the 6th Congress of the Pan African Burn Society and to your discovering Abidjan, “the pearl of lagoons”.

      On behalf of The Pan African Burn Society, I am pleased to announce that the 6th Pan African Burn Society Conference will be held May 12 - 15th, 2015 in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire and it is my pleasure to invite you to attend and participate in this conference. This meeting is unique in that it is the first time burn practitioners from Anglophone and Francophone Africa will be meeting together as a group in a Francophone country, to discuss common problems that plague the continent. It is refreshing to see this spirit of Pan Africanism where the real partnerships between nations on our continent blossom and flourish.

      This four-day congress will focus on and discuss a variety of interesting and important topics in burn and fire-related injury.  Topics will cover basic and updated items in the field of burn management, reconstruction, epidemiology, rehabilitation, etc. There will also be an essential Burn Course which will be run in collaboration with our partners Interburns from the United Kingdom.


      Exciting cultural and social programs are planned giving this conference a captivating African experience. I sincerely hope you will join us in sharing this major event in Abidjan in May 2015. Looking forward to seeing you there.

      Best regards,

      It’s a real pleasure and a great honor for me, President of the Organizing Committee, to invite all of you from May 12th to 15th, 2015, for the next Pan African Congress of Burns in Abidjan, the economic capital of Cote d’Ivoire.

      I’m very happy because it’s the first time that a French speaking country from West Africa has the opportunity to gather both Anglophone and Francophone burn communities from North, South, West and East Africa and even from other continents.

      Being all together  at one time in the same place, to share similar but such different experiences from different countries, with one common goal – to give better quality of life for burn victims – seems to be a dream!

      « Côte d’Ivoire is back » after a long and painful period of crisis; it’s coming back, multicultural, multiethnic and multi-religious, land of hospitality where the economic stakes are high and where everyone, wherever he comes from, is welcomed with open arms, in tolerance and peace. What a beautiful message broadcast to the whole world, through such profound words of Abidjanaise, our national hymn: “Hi, O land of Esperance, country of hospitality… Our duty will be to be a model of the promised hope to Humanity by forging, united in the new faith, the homeland of the true fraternity…”

      We’ll  welcome you in a living city where, alongside the scientific activities of the congress, you’ll visit Abidjan, “the pearl of lagoons”, a boomtown with modern architecture that contrasts with the remains of colonial time that you’ll discover just at a few minutes from Abidjan, in the old town of Grand Bassam along the seaside. Our beaches are beautiful on the coast, but a few miles away, in Yamoussoukro, the birthplace of Felix Houphouët Boigny, father of the Ivorian nation, discover the jewel of Christendom: the stunning Basilica of Yamoussoukro, the replica of St Peter in Rome - his dream, a reality, in a modern city in the heart of the forest.

      The topic of the 6th Congress of PABS, « Compassion and Education, A New Horizon for Burns in Africa » will symbolize a new hope, which, beyond the community of burns in Africa, will be open worldwide. Indeed, the Organizing Committee  includes  African colleagues in charge of burns in Côte d’Ivoire,  Togo,  Ghana,  Nigeria,  Egypt, and  South Africa  but also an international  panel of experts from Europe, North America and many other countries  including India in particular.

      We strive to present to you an interesting and innovative scientific program but also to offer you entertaining and original social activities so that when you go back home, you'll retain excellent memories of PABS 2015 and Côte d'Ivoire.

      So dear Guests and Colleagues,  note in your diary the dates of May 12th to 15th, 2015.  The Organizing Committee and it’s President, wish to welcome all of you very soon to Abidjan for the 6th Pan African Congress of Burns.

      Best regards,

      The Burn Family is very large, from Cotonou to Lome, from Abidjan to Indore, from Swansea to Toronto, from Ottawa to Montreal, Paris, Cape Town, Lagos, Accra, Abuja, Ouagadougou, Dacca, Kathmandu…

      I could continue for pages and pages, together we are unified with the same will.  To increase the public awareness of the importance of prevention in burns, to stimulate exchange of experience between the developed  North and  the emerging South; the knowledge translation, the standardisation in practice, the support of the research, and promotion of the creation of  an international Burn Registry; coaching and teaching how to have  good governance, be action oriented, and focus on the  local needs.

      I would like to thank those men and women who came on a voluntary basis, collaborated and worked together to reach those noble goals for the last three years.

      To all steering committee members of the West Africa initiatives, Thank you!

  history:
    title: "Brief history of the Pan African Burn Society"
    text1: "The Pan African Burn Society (PABS) was founded on May 17th, 2004 in Cape Town, South Africa, as a scientific society whose members were almost exclusively from English-speaking African countries at the time. The First President of the Society was <b>Dr. Elbie van der Merwe</b> who was the head of the Tygerberg Hospital Burns Unit and the Secretary was Dr. Ina Steenkamp. Drs van der Merwe and Steenkamp were replaced by <b>Drs. Richard Nnabuko and Okechukwu Onumaegbu</b> as PABS President and Secretary respectively in November 2013.<br><br>The objectives of the <b>PABS</b> are:"
    objective_list:
      item1: "to improve the overall care of the many burn victims in Africa"
      item2: "to ensure adequate training of practitioners that support it"
      item3: "to sensitize governments and target populations on burns in Africa - a scourge which requires effective public education and awareness."
      item4: "to cooperate, with efforts of the international community, so that management of burns in Africa can be in line with the WHO's guidelines and recommendations which have accepted burns as a public health problem."
    text2: "The activities of the PABS include among other things, the organization of regular meetings of scientific interest and the topics often covered at these conferences include therapeutic management, clinical and technological research, education and prevention. The choice of topics is often oriented on themes of common interest to developing countries where difficulties are often similar but with variable severity in different countries. In addition, these conferences provide participants with highly specialized teaching quality, through conferences updating of knowledge from courses taught by international experts.<br><br>The PABS encourages each country to create a local burns society for organizing regular seminars and training workshops at national levels. The PABS in 2005 became the last regional bloc to join the <b>International Society for Burn Injuries</b> - <b>ISBI</b> and Dr. van Der Merwe served as the regional representative for Africa on the ISBI Committee for about four years.<br><br>Since its inception, the PABS has held five (5) congresses:<br><b>South Africa</b>, May 2004<br><b>Egypt</b>, January 2007<br><b>Nigeria</b>, December 2008<br><b>South Africa</b>, February 2011<br><b>Ghana</b>, November 2013<br><br><b>InterBurns</b> whose mission is in the training of burn care practitioners through interactive workshops practice in low and middle income countries of South East Asia and Africa became a partner with the PABS in November 2013 and has been the agents for organizing and training practitioners on the Essential Burn Care course. Interburns in collaboration with the PABS has set up a training centre for Africa at the Burns and Plastic Surgery Department of the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, Ghana."

    title1: "INSURANCE"
    text1: |
      <b>Registration fees do not include insurance of any kind.</b> It is strongly recommended that at the time you register for the conference and book your travel you take out an insurance policy of your choice.
      The policy should include loss of fees/deposit through cancellation of your participation in the conference, or through cancellation of the conference, loss of international/domestic air fares through cancellation for any reason, loss of tour monies through cancellation for any reason including airline or related services strikes, failure to utilize tours or pre booked arrangements due to airline delay, force majeure or any other reason, medical expenses (including sickness and accident coverage), loss or damage to personal property, and additional expenses and penalties to change the travel dates.
      <b>The organizing committee of the Congress will not be responsibe for any participant failing to arrange their own insurance.</b> This insurance is to be purchased in your country of origin.
    title2: "AIRPORT AND TRANSPORT"
    text2: |
      <b>The International Airport</b> <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Houphou%C3%ABt-Boigny">Félix-Houphouët-Boigny</a>, is in Port-Bouët, a sector in the district of Abidjan, and is approximately 11 miles from the business center.
      It’s the hub of the new domestic airline <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_C%C3%B4te_d%27Ivoire">Air Côte d'Ivoire</a>.
      Félix Houphouët-Boigny Airport is well connected to Europe and other countries of West Africa through 20 airlines serving the airport and covering more than 35 destinations
    text3: |
      Passengers of the United States must enter via Casablanca, France, or Dubai because American authorities have not yet certified the Abidjan airport for direct connection to the United States.
      The Felix Houphouet-Boigny airport in Abidjan South is relatively well served by roads that currently connect to the Abidjan city center within fifteen minutes depending on the traffic flow; the next issue of the third bridge will shorten this period, connecting the airport and the Riviera Golf quickly.
    abidjan_map_text: |
      The south and north parts of Abidjan, the « pearl of lagoons », are actually connected by the <b>Félix Houphouët Boigny bridge</b> (1957) and the Charles De Gaulle bridge (1967) ; the next delivery of the 3rd bridge in December 2014, called <b>Henri Konan Bedie</b>  (name of the 2nd President of Côte d'Ivoire) will allow greater traffic flow and facilitate quick access to the airport
    text4: |
      The airport hosts a taxi meter orange station, as well as car rental services.
      For PABS 2015, it is important that participants to the congress specify the date, time and origin of their flight to organize their reception on arrival; if necessary, for safety it is strongly recommended to use shuttles operated by major hotels in the city, connecting the airport directly to the hotel associated with the shuttle (Golf Hotel & Hotel Horizon).
    title3: "BANKING / CURRENCY"
    text5: |
      The currency in Côte d’Ivoire is the FRANC CFA (UEMOA/XOF) with banknotes (500, 1000, 2000, 5000 & 10000) and coins (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250 & 500).

      Parity is fixed relative to the euro (€ 1 = 655.96 # 656 F.CF; # 100 CFA € 0.50 or USD 1 USD = 507.67 XOF; 100 F CFA # 0.20 USD). The euro is accepted in banks, but also by traders of big cities.
      <b>Currency exchange</b> is easy in Abidjan (banks & exchange offices and hotels).
      Other methods of payment by <b>credit cards</b> (Visa, American Express, MasterCard, etc.) are generally accepted in Abidjan but sometimes denied inside where there are few distributors.
      <b>Traveler's checks</b> are not always accepted outside major banks, some hotels and shops in Abidjan.
    title4: "CLIMATE AND CLOTHING"
    text6: |
      The sub-equatorial climate is characterized by low fluctuation of temperatures and a high humidity (> 80%). Abidjan has two dry seasons and two wet seasons.
      May is the beginning of the long rainy season with rather limited sunlight (about 6 hours a day) and some rain at times. The sun rises and sets around 06:30 to 18:30. Average temperatures are between 77 and 89.6°F (25 – 32°C) but depending on time of year they can drop to 68°F (20°C) and mostly peak up to 91.4°F (33°C).  Anyway, do not take warm cloths!
      No special clothing is required during the work day but one/two suits/dresses could be useful for formal official events organized as part of the Congress.
      Bring beachwear and swimwear for the pool of the hotel between sessions or if the call of the sea and coconut trees is irresistible ... but nevertheless, do not forget to protect yourself against possible rain (umbrellas and raincoats might be very useful at the beginning of the wet season!)
    title5: "EATING"
    text7: |
      <b>Breakfast is included in room rates. Coffee breaks and lunches are included in the registration of Congress delegates from May 12th to 15th, 2015</b>; meal tickets will be available for accompanying persons during this period.
      For meals before and after the conference period and for the personal dinners, many coffee shops, snack bars and restaurants offer varied menus at different prices depending on their standing. Our typical "maquis" offer African dishes and grilled meat or fish usually at cheaper prices than in conventional restaurants.
      Some facilities specialize in gastronomy from other countries (Vietnam, China, Italy, Lebanon, etc.)
      The <b>sale and consumption of alcohol</b> in establishments are free (except for minors).
    title6: "ELECTRICITY"
    text8: |
      Electrical current is 220 V, AC 50Hz. The outlets are 2 round terminals (or 3 rounds with ground). If your appliances are 110V, check if there is a 110/240V switch.  If not, you’ll need a voltage converter. Ideally for electrical outlets may be to provide a multiple outlets adapter.
    title7: "LANGUAGE"
    text9: |
      Côte d’Ivoire has many ethnic groups that explain the diversity of dialects but the official language of the country is French, spoken by more than 95% of the population.
      <b>As the congress of the PABS will held  for the first time in a French speaking West African country, the organizing committee will ensure that all works be presented in French & in English</b>. To achieve all translations <b>it's imperative that the abstracts, texts and slides of   lectures and communications arrive to the scientific committee within the specified time limit</b>.
    title8: "PASSPORT & VISA INFORMATION"
    text10: |
      All visitors to Côte d’Ivoire, except those from the 15 countries members of ECOWAS (Bénin, Bukina Faso, Cap Vert, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambie, Ghana, Guinée, Guinée Bissau, Libéria, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sénégal, Togo) and those from the following countries: Centrafrique, Congo Brazzaville, Mauritanie, Maroc, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Tchad, et Tunisie (non exhaustive listing, to be verified), must have valid passport and visa.

    title9: "VACCINATION & MEDICAL INFORMATION"
    text11: |
      <b>Inoculation against yellow fever</b> is compulsory, done at least 10 days before departure.
      As this vaccine can't be done by your doctor, you should go in the nearest approved center to do it. Check this carefully with your airline or travel agent.
      Furthermore, <b>malaria</b> prophylaxis is highly recommended as well as protection against insect bites (dark clothing, anti mosquito lotion, etc.) during outdoors exhibitions in evening.
      <b>Tap water distributed in Abidjan is potable</b> but we recommend that you drink bottled mineral water (local or imported).
      <b>If health concerns</b> occur, many health facilities and especially private clinics have efficient technical facilities and skilled staff to answer your problems. We do not recommend public hospitals. Finally, <b>in case of emergency</b>, the Emergency Medical Service (SAMU-CI) works 24h/7d.
      <b>We recommend once more that you arrange insurance for any medical expenses on site or for repatriation to your home country.</b>
    title10: "SHOPPING"
    text12: |
      Shops are open from 09:00 to 18:00 hours during the week but some of them are closed between 12:00 and 15:00; most of them are open on Saturday but closed on Sunday. Supermarkets and food shops are open on Sunday morning.
      Prices of articles sold in shops are generally displayed tax included (VAT).

      The outlet of artisanal objects (djembé drums, statuettes, masks, etc.) even non authentic pieces is in principle subject to authorization from the National Museum; demand for these permits at departure is very random but can sometimes cause some inconvenience at the airport.
    title11: "TIPPING"
    text13: |
      Tipping is not required and that is your prerogative, a reward for service.
      It is customary to tip hotel porters and a gratuity of about 10 per cent is usual in restaurants if good service is received.
      Tips for taxis are regarded as optional but it’s recommended to have the currency because taxi drivers have it rarely!
    title12: "RELIGION & CULTS"
    text14: |
      Almost all religions are practiced in Côte d'Ivoire: Islam (38%), Christianity (22%), Protestantism (5.5%), traditional animist religions (17%) and some other religions are the most common (17%).
      There are a wide variety of religious buildings to offer many practitioners places of worship.
    title13: "TIME"
    text15: |
      Abidjan is at the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
