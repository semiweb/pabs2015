      My extraordinary happiness and pleasure about this important event is because it is the first time that the Anglophones and Francophones Burn community meet at the same time. Moreover, it is the first time that this meeting takes place in a Francophone country. I will love to see you all from the North, the East, the West and the South of African corners at the same place and time and in my country: what a wonderful dream coming true.

      Cote d’Ivoire is back, multicultural, multi ethnic, and multi religious country, offering hospitality with tolerance and peace; a great message for Africa and the entire world.

      On behalf of The Pan African Burn Society, I am pleased to announce that the 6th Pan African Burn Society Conference will be held on May 12 -15th, 2015 in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire and it is my pleasure to invite you to attend and participate at this conference. This meeting is unique in that it is the first time burn practitioners from Anglophone and Francophone Africa will be meeting together as a group to discuss common problems that plague the continent. It is refreshing to see this spirit of Pan Africanism where the real partnerships between nations on our continent blossom and flourish.

      This four-day congress will focus on, and discuss a variety of interesting and important topics in burn and fire-related injury.  Topics will cover basic and updated items in the field of burn management, reconstruction, epidemiology, rehabilitation, etc. There will also be an essential Burn Course which will be run in collaboration with our partners Interburns from the United Kingdom.

      Exciting cultural and social programs are planned giving this conference a captivating African experience. I sincerely hope most of you will join us in sharing this major event in Abidjan in May 2015. Looking forward to seeing you there.

      Best regards,

      It’s a real pleasure and a great honor for me, President of the Organizing Committee, to invite all of you from May 12th to 15th, 2015, for the next Pan African Congress of Burns in Abidjan, the economic capital of Cote d’Ivoire,

      I’m very happy because it’s the first time that a French speaking country from West Africa has the opportunity to gather as Anglophone than francophone burns ‘communities from North, South, West and East Africa and even from other continents.

      Being all together at one time and at the same place to share similar but so different experiences in different countries, with the only common goal to give better conditions of life for burnt people, seems to be a wonderful dream!

      <i>« Côte d’Ivoire is back »</i> after a long and painful period of crisis; its coming back, multicultural, multiethnic and multi-religious, land of hospitality where the economic stakes are high and where everyone, wherever he comes from, is welcomed with open arms, in tolerance and peace. What a beautiful message broadcast to the whole world, if only through such profound words of Abidjanaise, our national anthem: <i>“Hi, O land of Esperance, country of hospitality… Our duty to be a model of the promised hope to Humanity by forging, united in the new faith, the homeland of the true fraternity…”</i>

      We’ll welcome you in a living city where, alongside the scientific activities of the congress, you’ll visit Abidjan, ‘the pearl of lagoons”, boomtown with modern architecture that contrast with the remains of colonial time that  you’ll discover also at a few minutes from Abidjan, in the old town of Grand Bassam along the seaside. Our beaches are beautiful, nearby, in Grand Bassam and Assinie on the coast but, a few miles away, you’ll be surprised by the birthplace of Felix Houphouët Boigny, father of the Ivorian nation whose dream became a reality, was to build in the heart of the forest, a modern city where is proudly erected the jewel of Christendom: the stunning Basilica of Yamoussoukro, the replica of St Peter in Roma.

      The topic of the 6th Congress of PABS, « Compassion and Education, New horizons in Africa » will symbolize a new hope, which, beyond the community of burns in Africa, will be open to worldwide. Indeed, the Organizing Committee  includes  African colleagues in charge of burns in Côte d’Ivoire,  Togo,  Ghana,  Nigeria,  Egypt, and  South Africa  but also an international  panel of experts from Europe (Britain, France), North America (USA, Canada) and many other countries  including India in particular.

      We all strive to present you an interesting and innovative scientific program but also to offer you entertaining and original social activities so that when you'll go back home, you'll retain excellent memories of PABS 2015 and Côte d'Ivoire.

      So dear Guests and Colleagues, already note in your diary, the dates of May 12th to 15th, 2015.

      The organizing committee and its President, wish to welcome all of you very soon in Abidjan for the 6th Pan African Congress of Burns.

      Best regards,

      Brigitte Vilasco

      The Burn Family is very large, from Cotonou to Lome, from Abidjan to Indore, from Swansea to Toronto, from Ottawa to Montreal, Paris, Cape Town, Lagos, Accra, Abuja, Ouagadougou, Dacca, Kathmandu…

      I could continue for pages and pages, together we are unified with the same will.  To increase the public awareness of the importance of prevention in burns, to stimulate exchange of experience between the developed  North and  the emerging South; the knowledge translation, the standardisation in practice, the support of the research, and promotion of the creation of  an international Burn Registry; coaching and teaching how to have  good governance, be action oriented, and focus on the  local needs.

      I would like to thank those men and women who came on a voluntary basis, collaborated and worked together to reach those noble goals for the last three years.

      To all steering committee members of the West Africa initiatives, Thank you!

    title: "Brief history of the Pan African Burn Society"
    text1: "The Pan African Burn Society (PABS) was founded on May 17th, 2004 in Cape Town, South Africa, as a scientific society whose members were almost exclusively from English-speaking African countries at the time. The First President of the Society was <b>Dr. Elbie van der Merwe</b> who was the head of the Tygerberg Hospital Burns Unit and the Secretary was Dr. Ina Steenkamp. Drs van der Merwe and Steenkamp were replaced by <b>Drs. Richard Nnabuko and Okechukwu Onumaegbu</b> as PABS President and Secretary respectively in November 2013.<br><br>The objectives of the <b>PABS</b> are:"
    objective_list:
      item1: "to improve the overall care of the many burn victims in Africa"
      item2: "to ensure adequate training of practitioners that support it"
      item3: "to sensitize governments and target populations on burns in Africa - a scourge which requires effective public education and awareness."
      item4: "to cooperate, with efforts of the international community, so that management of burns in Africa can be in line with the WHO's guidelines and recommendations which have accepted burns as a public health problem."
    text2: "The activities of the PABS include among other things, the organization of regular meetings of scientific interest and the topics often covered at these conferences include therapeutic management, clinical and technological research, education and prevention. The choice of topics is often oriented on themes of common interest to developing countries where difficulties are often similar but with variable severity in different countries. In addition, these conferences provide participants with highly specialized teaching quality, through conferences updating of knowledge from courses taught by international experts.<br><br>The PABS encourages each country to create a local burns society for organizing regular seminars and training workshops at national levels. The PABS in 2005 became the last regional bloc to join the <b>International Society for Burn Injuries</b> - <b>ISBI</b> and Dr. van Der Merwe served as the regional representative for Africa on the ISBI Committee for about four years.<br><br>Since its inception, the PABS has held five (5) congresses:<br><b>South Africa</b>, May 2004<br><b>Egypt</b>, January 2007<br><b>Nigeria</b>, December 2008<br><b>South Africa</b>, February 2011<br><b>Ghana</b>, November 2013<br><br>The 6th Congress of the PABS is scheduled to be held in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire from the 12th to the 15th of May 2015, and for the first time since its inception will feature a meeting that involves and tries to bring burn practitioners from Anglophone and Francophone Africa together.<br><br><b>InterBurns</b> whose mission is in the training of burn care practitioners through interactive workshops practice in low and middle income countries of South East Asia and Africa became a partner with the PABS in November 2013 and has been the agents for organizing and training practitioners on the Essential Burn Care course.
